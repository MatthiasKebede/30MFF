Project Name: A Day in the Life at NYUAD

Concept: Our film was an Instagram reel-style video going around campus and showing off what a day in a student's life might look like at NYUAD. The site as a whole sticks to the same idea, sort of aiming to paint a picture of campus life and appeal to potential students. The style was pretty cut-and-dry, using the NYU colours and basically emulating a university page but with some additional interactivity thrown in.

Process: My wireframe had most of what I wanted to implement, so I just laid the foundation of the HTML and then started adding tne CSS and JavaScript. With all the text, images, and the video in place I just put in the changing background colour and spent some time getting the image carousel working properly and looking nice enough.

Reflection/Evaluation: I think my site went pretty well, but my plan was simple to begin with and it still took a good bit of effort to get everything in. Overall it met my expectations, but I was surprised that all of the positioning and aesthetic aspects were so involved, especially in comparison to the functional parts. Regardless, it was an interesting experience.
